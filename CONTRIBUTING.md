# How to contribute

## Feature development lifecycle




## Coding conventions

- ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.
- Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
- Make sure all your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
- Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
    ```
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

    ```
